plugin-SocialBookmarking
========================

Inserts a list of social bookmarking sites to the bottom of each item in an Omeka archive, 
so that public users can easily share items they like with their social networks.

This fork includes the configuration of an optional AddThisId which enables the user to
track shares via their AddThis account analytics.
